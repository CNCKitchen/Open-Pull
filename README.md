# Open-Pull
These are all the files you need, to build your own DIY Universal test machine.

# Build one
## Hardware/CAD
CAD files of the whole assembly are available as stl, step and Fusion360 files.
### Bill of Materials (BOM)
* 2x NEMA 17 Stepper Motors 1.68A, Geared 14:1
* 2x Trapezoidal Lead Screw 10x2 500mm
* 2x Coupling 8/10mm
* 2x Trapezoidal Nut 10x2, Steel
* 2x Trapezoidal Nut with Flange, Brass
* 2x Angular Contact Bearing, 3200 2RS
* 2x Ball Bearing, 6202
* 4x Ball Bearing, 608
* ...

## Electronics
Currently the electronics are only as schematics and as images. I'd be happy if anyone made a PCB design for it for easier use.
### Bill of Materials (BOM)
* 1x Arduino Nano
* 2x A4988 Stepper Motor Driver
* 1x HX711 Load Cell Amplifier
* 1x 24V fan
* 1x 5A 24V Power Supply
* 1x Load Cell of suitable size (AEP TC4 - 5kN in my case)
* ...

## Software
Software is currently only the Arduino code for the machine itself, very rudimentary and not optimized. Everything is controlled via the serial terminal.

__UPDATE__: OpenPull Web-Controller(by Iqwertz): https://github.com/Iqwertz/OpenPull-Web-Controller

The general functionality is explained in this video: https://youtu.be/uvn-J8CbtzM
# Commands
* __M10__: Slow test (1mm/min)
* __M12__: Tare
* __M13__: Modulus test - 1mm/min for 30s, then 25mm/min
* __M14__: Fast test (25mm/min)
# Evaluation
The data is currently analyzed via [EXCEL sheets](Documents/DataAnalysis.xlsx).

The strain data is captured via an optical extensometer using a standard camera. I explain the procedure in my video, the tracking marker export script can be found in [Documents](Documents).
